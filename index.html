            <p style="color: #000">We take EVA Air every year to taiwan in the summer and then take another trip so other parts of asia to places like shanghai, xi’an, beijing, tokyo, osaka, kyoto, macau, hong kong, canada, iceland, netherlands, UK, Belgium, Czech Rep., I have taken 1st class once. We go to the lounge before takeoff. My favorite part of traveling is flying because taking off and landing since it feels so cool and also free movies! Every where we go we make sure to hit all the most popular sites and try out all the local foods. Last summer, we went to Osaka and Kyoto, we had lots of Kobe beef and fabulous seafood. My favorite meal there was a all-you-can-eat Wagyu beef hot pot as well as all-you-can-eat king crab.

            <p style="color: #000">My favorite ski resorts are Whistler-Blackcomb, Whiteface and vail. They’re all giant ski resorts with state of the art equipment
                I love to ski down glades (tree trails) but I hate moguls, they strain your knees so much it hurts. I ski every year with a giant group of people and we go to a different ski resort every christmas break. This year we went to Mont Tremblant. I used to ski competitively but found that casual skiing with friends was much better. I have a GoPro that I use to record myself skiing down the mountain. We mainly drive to the ski resorts that we go to like Stowe, Loon and Killington. I want to go heli-skiing in the back bowls of Whistler-Blackcomb. I enjoy the exhilarating feeling barreling down the mountain at 60mph.
